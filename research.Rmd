The Berndsen lab is interested in two areas: the enzymatic mechanisms of acyl transfer and viral tethering by the protein Tetherin. Lab projects on these topics use a variety of techniques and approaches from measurement of enzyme activity to observing protein structure  through X-ray crystallography and computational methods. 

We also work with collaborators on and off campus to help answer questions involving protein structure and function. 

There are several opportunities for undergraduate students to perform research in the lab both during the academic year and summer, please contact Dr. Berndsen for more information.

The Berndsen lab is also associated with the [JMU Center for Genome and Metagenome Studies](http://www.jmu.edu/genomics/).

##Enzymatic Mechanism of Acyl Transfer

Cellular proteins are often modified with chemical moieties such as phosphate or methyl groups in order to alter the function of these proteins in response to changes in the environment or during the cell cycle. Two of these post-translational modifications, acetylation and ubiquitination, involve a reaction of a thioester with an amine.  While the reaction chemistry is straightforward, the enzymatic mechanism of transfer is not clear and there are a variety of protein structures that can do this chemistry.  We aim to determine the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes via biochemical and structural methods to understand:

* how substrates bind 

* the enzyme increases the rate of the reaction

* the role of changes in the enzyme structure in the reaction chemistry

* how substrate specificity is encoded by the enzyme

Current projects are focused on ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like activating enzymes, cleavage of ubiquitin precursors, and enzymatic modification of protein lysines.

## Viral Tethering by human Tetherin

All humans contain a simple protein known as BST-2 or Tetherin which has the innate ability to latch onto budding viruses and tether the virus to the host cell membrane.  Other than a mechanical tether, there are no known functions for Tetherin and it is not exactly clear how this protein functions. We combine biophysical and  computational approaches to determine the structural mechanism of viral tethering and how viral antagonists block the function of Tetherin
