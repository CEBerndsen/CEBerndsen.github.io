This website is an outlet for me to share with my students and the public fun insights in Biochemistry and data. I will add new posts or information as I have time and the interest. 

Feel free to explore the site to learn more about our research and other activities! 

You can also see what is going on with me and the lab via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kcat_km).

We also occasionally post new materials on [Github](https://github.com/CEBerndsen).
